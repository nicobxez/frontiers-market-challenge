## Requirements

Please recreate the homepage [https://frontiersmarket.com/](https://frontiersmarket.com/) on your server (preferably firebase) as a static website and create a chat widget (design it yourself) that will overlay the website.

The chat widget should display the ongoing conversations with the chatbot or a real person. There can be only one ongoing conversation per user. Please use firestore to store the conversations. Chat can be connected to any chatbots api of your choice.

As an extra activity you can design a sign in functionality that will allow users to sign in with their google account based on firebase authentication.
The website and the chat should be written in typescript.

#### Features that will be evaluated:

- Website translation
- Chat design
- Loading speed
- Chat response time
- API integrations with third party
- Data model for storing conversations for signed in and guest users
